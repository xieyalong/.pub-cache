# Examples

Some example analysis options files.

* [all.yaml](all.yaml) - auto-generated options enabling all lints.
* [effective-dart](effective-dart) - a manually maintained list of lints that correspond to "Effective Dart" recommendations.

For more on lint rule sets see the analyzer docs on
[customizing static analysis](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/analyzer#customizing-static-analysis).

For a canonical set of rules used internally at Google and by an increasing number of tools, see
[`package:pedantic`](https://github.com/dart-lang/pedantic).
