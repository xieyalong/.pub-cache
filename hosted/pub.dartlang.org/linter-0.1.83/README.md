# Linter for Dart

The Dart Linter package defines lint rules that identify and report on "lints" found in Dart code.  Linting is performed by the Dart
analysis server and the `dartanalyzer` commandline tool.

## Installing

The linter is bundled with the Dart [SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk); if you have an updated Dart SDK already, you're done!

Alternatively, if you want to contribute to the linter or examine the source, clone the `linter` repo like this:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dart-lang/linter.git

## Usage

The linter gives you feedback to help you catch potential errors and keep your code in line with the published [Dart Style Guide](https://www.dartlang.org/articles/style-guide/). Currently enforceable lint rules (or "lints") are catalogued [here][lints] and can be configured via an [analysis options file][options_file].  The linter is run from within the `dartanalyzer` [command-line tool](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/analyzer_cli#dartanalyzer) shipped with the Dart SDK.  Assuming you have lints configured in an `analysis_options.yaml` file with these contents:

```
linter:
  rules:
    - annotate_overrides
    - hash_and_equals
    - prefer_is_not_empty
```
you could lint your package like this:

    $ dartanalyzer --options analysis_options.yaml .
    
and see any violations of the `annotate_overrides`, `hash_and_equals`, and `prefer_is_not_empty` rules in the console.  To help you choose the rules you want to enable for your package, we have provided a [complete list of rules][lints] and a growing list of [lints according to the Effective Dart guide][effective-dart-lints]. For the lints that are enforced internally at Google, see [package:pedantic][package-pedantic].

If a specific lint warning should be ignored, it can be flagged with a comment.  For example, 

```dart
   // ignore: avoid_as
   (pm as Person).firstName = 'Seth'
```

tells the `dartanalyzer` to ignore this instance of `avoid_as` warning.  As lints are treated the same as errors and warnings by the analyzer, their severity can similarly be configured in an options file.  For example, an analysis options file that specifies

```
linter:
  rules:
    - avoid_as
analyzer:
  errors:
    avoid_as: error
```  

tells the analyzer to treat `avoid_as` lints as errors.  For more on configuring analysis see the analysis option file [docs][options_file].

## Contributing
