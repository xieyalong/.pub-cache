## How to use?

Because 1.3.0 has made great changes to the internal, version 1.3.0-1.3.9 is not recommended to use,there has a lot of Bug , 1.4.0 began to stabilize.
```

   dependencies:
     pull_to_refresh: ^1.4.4

```

```

import 'package:pull_to_refresh/pull_to_refresh.dart';

RefreshController _refreshController;

initState(){

    super.initState();
    // if you need refreshing when init,notice:initialRefresh is new  after 1.3.9
    _refreshController = RefreshController(initialRefresh:true);

}

void _onRefresh(){

   /*.  after the data return,
        use _refreshController.refreshComplete() or refreshFailed() to end refreshing
   */
}

void _onLoading(){
   /*
        use _refreshController.loadComplete() or loadNoData() to end loading
   */
}

build(){
...
SmartRefresher(
      enablePullDown: true,
      enablePullUp: true,
      header: defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.iOS?WaterDropHeader():WaterDropMaterialHeader(),
      controller: _refreshController,
      onRefresh: _onRefresh,
      onLoading: _onLoading,
      child: "yourContentScrollView",
    )
....
}

// don't forget to dispose refreshController
void dispose(){
    _refreshController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
}

```


In addition, if you have almost the same header and tail indicators for each page, consider using RefreshConfiguration
, which reduces the repeatability of constructing headers and footers for each new page.
At the same time, you can also set some global properties, such as whether to turn on automatic loading, refresh the trigger distance, whether to automatically hide the tail indicator should not meet a page.
the [example](https://github.com/peng8350/flutter_pulltorefresh/blob/master/example/lib/ui/MainActivity.dart) in my demo
```

    RefreshConfiguration(
        headerBuilder: () => WaterDropHeader(),
        footerBuilder:  () => ClassicFooter(),
        clickLoadingWhenIdle: true,
         headerTriggerDistance: 80.0,
         hideFooterWhenNotFull: true,
        child: .....
    )

```

## Frequent problems
* <h3>IOS Status Bar Double-click Why ListView does not automatically scroll to the top?</h3>
This problem is not my encapsulation error after testing. When the controller in ListView is replaced, this problem will occur, probably
because of the processing operation in Scaffold.,please issue flutter。

* <h3>Is Supporting NestedScrollView?</h3>
It's not recommended to use NestedScrollView. Now I have found a problem that I need to modify the internal source code of
 NestedScrollView to solve. So it's better to use CustomScrollView to avoid using it, because there may be many unknown
 problems that I haven't found yet.

* <h3>Why is there a empty space in the top or tail indicator after using CuperNavigationBar (not just in this case)?</h3>
the reason may be SafeArea,the solution: wrap SmartRefresher in SafeArea

* <h3>Compatibility?</h3>
1.3.0 replaces a new method to implement the indicator. The internal indicator is implemented by monitoring scroll Controller position changes. There are no methods such as NotificationListener and GestureDector that may cause sliding gesture conflicts.
So it should be compatible with most of the libraries that need to be used between gestures. However, some libraries may not be compatible and ScrollPhysics needs to be rewritten, which is clearly required for internal FrontStyle.
